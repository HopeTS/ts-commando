# End to end typescript boilerplate

This repo allows you to get off the ground quickly if you're trying to create something using typescript on the client and the server. The typescript in src/client compiles in public/dist, and the typescript in src/server compiles in src/server.

I made this while working on something else, and figured it might be useful for later :D
